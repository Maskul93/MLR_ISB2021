# Smartphone-Based Democratization of Jump Height Estimate

This small and humble repository has been created to show the core processing of what have been made for the ISB2021 abstract entitled *Smartphone-Based Democratization of Jump Height Estimate*. 

Smartphones are devices within everyone's reach, which IMUs can be exploited to accomplish many goals. Our goal was to optimize (I should say *to correct*) jump height estimates. 

The idea was to combine both **antropometric** and **time-frequency features**.
