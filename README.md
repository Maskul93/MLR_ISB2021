# Smartphone-Based Democratization of Jump Height Estimate

This small and humble repository has been created to show the core processing of what have been made for the ISB2021 abstract entitled *Smartphone-Based Democratization of Jump Height Estimate*. 

Smartphones are devices within everyone's reach, which IMUs can be exploited to accomplish many goals. Our goal was to optimize (I should say *to correct*) jump height estimates. 

The idea was to combine both **antropometric** and **time-frequency features**.

In this repository, you will find an *interactive* Python Notebook. If you are familiar with what such an environment is, just clone the repository and feel free to play with the code. If not, you can either install <a href = "https://www.python.org/">Python</a> (and <a href = "https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>) on your device, or clone it directly on your Google Drive cloud storage via <a href = "https://colab.research.google.com/">Colab</a>. Enjoy!

## Data Description

- ```./main.ipynb``` The main file, containing code and explanation;
- ```./data/cmj_smartphone.csv``` Measures coming from the smartphone IMU (acc and gyr) of a sample Countermovement jump;
- ```./data/cmj_forceplate.csv``` Measures coming from a force plaform (acc) of a sample Countermovement jump (the same). Notice that this is not a Ground Reaction Force, but the acceleration obtained neglecting the jumper mass.
- ```./data/a_glob.csv``` The smartphone vertical acceleration it was aligned to the World Reference Frame and the gravity component was removed;
- ```./misc``` Folder containing the images you find in this file;
- ```README.md``` This file! ðŸ˜„
